- _Google_: This sample app is forked from [Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) - a web-based e-commerce app called **“Hipster Shop”** where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them. The application works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one).

We'll be using Postman with the Gremlin API to shut down a single container. Spoiler alert . . . this is so we can easily automate these chaos tests with our continuous integration pipeline.

Import the Postman template called `Chaos engineering` and look for the folder called `Infrastructure attack` [insert link].
